# AnxietyResearch
Objective-C ResearchKit (without AppCore) demo app


All code currently in ViewController, to be refactored at a later date.

This demo app uses ResearchKit only and does not use AppCore.

Consent document code mostly taken from https://github.com/weberbry/ResearchKitConsentDemo with a very few slight modifications.

Most survey types are demonstrated including Form Items.

Two active tasks are demonstrated: Finger Tapping and Spatial Span Memory.
